                <h3>Kimchi</h3>
                <p>Kimchi is a must when it comes to Korean food. It's a staple and you won't be able to escape it once in Korea. And you most likely won't even want to. Every restaurant you go to, will bring a small plate of kimchi and something other, e.g. ginger or radish. When it's close to being empty, it's customary to bring more.</p>
                <h4>So what exactly is kimchi?</h4>
                <p>Kimchi is a traditional side dish of salted vegetables, such as napa cabbage and Korean radish. Seasoning often includes gochugaru (chili powder), spring onions, garlic, ginger and jeotgaal <i>(salted seafood)</i>. There are numerous varieties of kimchi made from varying vegetables as the primary ingredient. Traditionally kimchi is stored in large earthernware. Nowadays, kimchi refrigerators are more commonly used to store it.</p>
